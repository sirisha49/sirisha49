### 💬 A Little About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **agentic backend systems** that can reason across multiple data streams  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make systems learn context, not just logic  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **AI-driven products and analytics platforms**  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **open-source intelligence frameworks and product telemetry**  
- 💬 Ask me about **Spring Boot, LangChain, Power BI, or product experimentation frameworks**  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sirisha-karanam/) | [Email](mailto:saisirisha.nk@gmail.com)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can switch from debugging to brainstorming go-to-market ideas without changing playlists 🎧

## 🧩 Product Case Studies & Strategy Projects

- **Amazon – Revitalizing Alexa**  
  Explored why Alexa lost innovation momentum and proposed three internal AI initiatives tied to KPIs, product differentiation, and developer engagement.  
  *Result:* Mapped out $280M+ market recovery opportunity through conversational intelligence features.

- **LittleCo – Emerging Tech Adoption**  
  Designed a 3-phase innovation strategy introducing IoT and data agents into small-scale manufacturing.  
  *Result:* 25% improvement in workflow efficiency projected through automation pilots.

- **Uber – Driver Incentive Optimization (Concept)**  
  Reimagined dynamic pricing + driver incentives using predictive behavioral modeling.  
  *Focus:* Fair earnings distribution and improved trip reliability scores.

- **Capital One – Product Intelligence for Internal Platforms**  
  Built a data dashboard framework concept for tracking cross-team OKRs and customer impact.  
  *Result:* Simplified product decision reviews with unified data visualization.

- **DHL / E-Cargo Movers – SmartMiles**  
  Introduced scan-based delivery verification and ETL-powered analytics for route optimization.  
  *Impact:* 15% reduction in failed deliveries and better hub coordination.

## 🧭 How I Think

> “Good software doesn’t just execute — it understands.”

I build systems that combine **logic with intuition**, using:
- Adaptive reasoning agents  
- Data-backed decision models  
- Human-centered product strategy  

The goal is simple: make intelligence *feel* natural — invisible but powerful.
